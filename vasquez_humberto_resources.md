My favorite resource is YouTube, I've watched so many different obscure channels that discuss programming, DIY projects - they all fuel and further my interest in coding and software engineering. Engineer Man (about 370k subscribers) has a ton of videos for various languages, and they're all very thorough and well explained.

Codeacademy's Python course really helped me get invested in coding. It's been over two years since I completed it but being in Mod 0 is bringing a lot of those concepts I learned back to the surface.

Power Python by Aaron Maxwell is an interesting read - I'm not advanced enough with Python (yet), but having gone through it before I can tell it's going be a valuable resource. Just the initial chapter that talks about iterators and generators is worth it alone.
