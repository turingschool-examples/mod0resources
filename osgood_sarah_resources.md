### Modifier Keys

    * I love using capslock as my command key. Makes all the combinations for shortcuts so much easier!

### Short Cuts I love:

    * command + tab
        + navigate quickly through open programs

    * command + r
        + refresh a webpage

    * command + t
        + open a new tab in chrome

    * command + option + arrow Keys
        + move windows to the sides or top of my screen so I can see multiple programs at the same time.

### MDN page for Arrays

    * This was part of one of our Capstone Days, but I found that reading through it and trying out different
        arrays helped me understand more about what is happening.

### Git Hub Tutioral

    * I am not sure if I found this online or if it was somewhere in our homework or capstone, but I do know
        that I bookmarked it. I like looking at it and comparing it to what we are learning in class. I think
        it is why Session 3 was easier for me to grasp than the first two classes.
