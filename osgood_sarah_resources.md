Modifier Keys

  * I love using capslock as my command key. Makes all the combinations for shortcuts so much easier!

Short Cuts I love:

  * command + tab

    * navigate quickly through open programs

  * command + r
  
    + refresh a webpage

  * command + t

    + open a new tab in chrome

  * command + option + arrow Keys

    + move windows to the sides or top of my screen so I can see multiple programs at the same time.

MDN page for Arrays

  * This was part of one of our Capstone Days, but I found that reading through it and trying out different arrays helped me understand more about what is happening.

Git Hub Tutorial

  * I am not sure if I found this online or if it was somewhere in our homework or capstone, but I do know that I bookmarked it. I like looking at it and comparing it to what we are learning in class. I think it is why Session 3 was easier for me to grasp than the first two classes.
