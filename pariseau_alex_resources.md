The first experience I got with computer programming, it was in high school. While my teacher was good, the one thing I'll remember about her is not necessarily her teaching methods, or the tips and tricks she taught me, but how she had an eccentric story to tell for just about everything. There were a bunch of times when we were learning something and she'd get distracted and start expounding on one tale or another. And the story was always strange, goofy and entertaining, even if only tangentially related to what we were learning. I still did pretty well in learning Java, so the distractions weren't necessarily harmful to the learning environment, but they are the one thing I definitely cannot forget about her.

Might be another odd note, but when I started learning Python as well, one of the things I remembered when they would talk about commenting and documentation and references was that any Python documentation could be made better by slipping in Monty Python references. Whether it was a parrot pining for the fjords or a European or African swallow and coconuts, if you were trying to make up an example, you had to try and figure out what Monty Python sketch might be most applicable. And that made learning it always very fun.
