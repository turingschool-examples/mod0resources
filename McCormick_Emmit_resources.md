I have learned a lot over the years from working on independent projects, work related projects, and also just exploring the world wide web.

Since joining Turing I have been limited to Mod-0 and plan on doing more external research when I leave my job in a few weeks. During Prework I will find more and more resources.

The resources I have added outside of mod-0 are things like
