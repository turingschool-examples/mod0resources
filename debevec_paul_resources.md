Hello,
I've had a few resources that I've been able to utilize so far. The biggest, by far, is my older brother: Daniel.

1) Daniel has been working as a software engineer coding in Ruby for the last 4 years. He has been my biggest advocate for attending Turing, and he's made himself readily available every time I've had a question or need help with a concept.

2) Mod 0: I've tried learning github in the past, but I've never had it shown to me in the way that Mod 0 has taught it. After the first week I feel like my understanding is worlds beyond where I was before.

3) YouTube: I'm a very visual and hands on learner. So having the ability to watch a video of someone showing a concept, and then being able to practice it myself is amazing.

4) Codecademy offering github and Ruby tutorials is immensely helpful
