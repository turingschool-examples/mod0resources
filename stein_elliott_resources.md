1. No resource list for developers can't start without GOOGLE :)

2. Stack Overflow has been useful to use because you can see how popular of a topic it is. The green check mark next to answer is really helpful as well.

3. While completing the capstone, it's been helpful following a blogger called "Stacy learns to code". She follows Zed Shaw's book and exercises in "Learning Ruby the Hard Way." A lot of times she'll comment on a concept or idea and it's been helpful to hearing more explanation and reasoning behind some of the exercises.

4. Ruby-doc.org has been helpful for looking up individual functions/methods and how they will run in an IRB session.
