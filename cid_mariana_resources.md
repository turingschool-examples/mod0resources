One of my favorite resources thus far has been all of the shortcuts and commands with the keyboard, it's been so helpful
I don't know how I functioned without it!

Another resources has been the capstone itself. It has been so great in just going into depth about everything we've been learning in our sessions.

Google has been really helpful in finding more shortcuts to use in your terminal, text editor and just in your machine in general.

Slack has also been very helpful just by staying updated and keeping in touch with my mentor.
