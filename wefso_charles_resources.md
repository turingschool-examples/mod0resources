1. My wife has been my most valuable resource.
2. Reviewing the session walkthroughs and my notes.
3. Atlassian has a pretty straightforward into to git: atlassian.com/git
4. Git.io has been something that comes up every time I google something related to git so I have used that some.
5. I did various Code Academy courses on web design before applying to Turing, I think that has helped put me in a good mindset to code.
6. Stay Focused App and Spotify.
