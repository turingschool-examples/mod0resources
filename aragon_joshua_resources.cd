  <li>Turing has taught me how to use Github in 3 lessons. I had no clue what it was or how it worked prior.</li>
  <li>Git has been very interesting to learn, though I don't fully understand it yet I'm slowly getting the hang of it.</li>
  <li>I love how open Github is and how programmers share their code so openly with others. We're all in this together.</li>
