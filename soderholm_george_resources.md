I've found many resources as I tirelessly search for understanding in things that I don't fully grasp. These are some that stand out.

  1. DigitalOcean: *How To Code in Ruby* by Brian Hogan


    I found when I did the try coding weekend that this was a great resource for pretty basic but helpful instruction on many concepts.  I find myself coming back to Brian Hogan's explinations quite a lot.

  1. *Learn Ruby The Hard Way* by Zeb Shaw


    This is a resource we've been using a lot in our daily practice in the capstone, but I really like how he just lays it out and gives you things to practice.  I relish how he stresses writing things down and memorization.
    We haven't "had" to do all his exercises, but I have been!
