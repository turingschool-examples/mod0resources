I have really liked the recommended readings for the BE program. This includes Eloquent Ruby and Practical Object Oriented Programming in Ruby. I feel that they have really shed light into what I have learned in free online courses that don't go into code organization or the reasons behind why we do things a certain way. While I do feel a big chunk has been over my head reading these books has definitely been beneficial
