#  Coding Resources

## My commonly Resources.

I'd have to say my number one resource is obviously *Google*, I've had to google **A LOT** of things. *Stackoverflow* has really been helpful for me. And of course *Slack* has been helpful. My fellow Mod0'ers usually end up having the same sort of problems I've had. And as a Mod0 repeater, I've had the honor of *Zoom* helping some of the other students.
