# Arique Turing Resources

## Favorite resources regarding Turing, Github, Ect.

**If your github clone or download isn't working, you probably missed a step in setting up your computer.  So my favorite github resource is creating an SSH key.**

**This was given to me by someone who is prepping by starting on Mod 1 work.  This article talks about the two types of struggle that exist in coding, and how to identify the elements of Productive struggle**

**Mentor**
- Above all else, my most favorite resource from Turing is my mentor Natalia.  Talking with her and having her normalize some of my concerns while also having to push through some serious self-discipline lessons has been by far my most favorite resource.


**And this quote from our namesake really gets me in the mood to code:**

> We are not interested in the fact that the brain has the consistency of cold porridge. - Alan Turing


**Weird Coders & Their Sounds**
- In my first round of Mod 0, I was grateful for the brave souls who shared a fun element.  We all studied programming while listening to white noise or a fan sound in our headphones.  Like we downloaded a track and use it to block out other noises so that we can focus.  I thought I was a psycho, and I found my people through that ice breaker.
