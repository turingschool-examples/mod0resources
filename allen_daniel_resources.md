My first favorite source is the cheat cheat followed by students and teachers during class. I look at it during class and review it after and everything we have learned get cleared up.
My second favorite are all of the git commands. Like I was told at first, git has a hard initial curve... but once you get over it its easy to tell why git will be a good buddy in my work.
