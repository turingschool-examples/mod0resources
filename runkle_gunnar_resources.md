Resources that have helped me in my time becoming a software engineer have been:
Google! learning to google and also its a valuable resource
The mod0 sessions for references along with examples from the sessions
Git hub has resources that the practice exercises help us locate
Ruby docs as a backend developer this is important
Software developers themselves if they are available
