##Here are some of my favorite resources:

1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
1. *JavaScript & JQuery* by Jon Duckett
1. https://www.edx.org/, where I took most of an intro Python class to see if I enjoyed programming enough to do a bootcamp, and learned a lot of the important basic concepts.
