The Zoom Recordings of Turing sessions have been extremely useful for me to review after the initial session.  

Google has obviously been extremely useful for me to search after getting a first and general overview from some of my Turing documents.  Sometimes just seeing it explained many different ways has helped me to absorb the information.

My notebook has also been a great resource to reference after taking notes on our assigned readings.

Slack has been extremely useful as a reference.  Many of us seem to be stuck on similar issues, and to see the helpful info on Slack has been great.

And just being able to open up Terminal and continue to practice the teachings of the past couple sessions with the session curriculum open in front of me has been really great.
