Honestly the most helpful thing for me has been getting reps in. Going through other aspects of gitHub in class yesterday was cool. I actually replicated the process on other folders once I finished the day_1 capstone and found those directions.

gitHub has a phone app called Open hub which I downloaded yesterday and am excited to play with.

This explanation of pull requests was nice: https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/
