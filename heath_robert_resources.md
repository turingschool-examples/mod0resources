I've done quite a bit of Googling. I've found it really helpful to run into problems and then try to fix them by seeing what other people have done.
The Turing Website has been very helpful. I didn't receive my computer until yesterday, and I've had to go back restart everything. It hasn't been bad, though. On the contrary, I've enjoyed it.
I've kept a running list of shortcuts, which has been immensely helpful.
