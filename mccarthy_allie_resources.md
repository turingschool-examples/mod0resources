1. Treehouse - I've found their lessons to be informative and good for beginners
2. Mozilla - This was provided by the instructor in our first lesson, and it's been good for Javascript info
3. Stackoverflow - There has been some good stuff on this, and when it hasn't been good, it's be interesting to learn why it didn't work
4. Other people - Most of what I already know about coding comes from people I used to work with
