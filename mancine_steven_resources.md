## Top Resources I've come across
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) was a great simple introduction to coding. you can work through courses at your own pace
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a good resource to if you have any questions
* [Typing](https://typing.io) is something I always felt like I was good at until I started to play around with code. This website has prewritten code that you can practice and will give you instant feed back on how you're doing.
* [Git is confusing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) this is a handy little ebook that I have been able to turn to for some information.  
* [Github resources](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/overview)for when you are have a confusing time with github
