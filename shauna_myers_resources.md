- Completing an apprenticeship application
process was actually the most helpful for me
and really set me up for success for this part of the learning process.
   - Through this application process I was
   able to install git (and had to learn to
   use my terminal), had to add, commit, leave commit messages, and push to my repository on GitHub.
   - Like you guys have accentuated: It's a steep learning curve...but once you've read up on it and played around with it a little then you feel comfortable.
