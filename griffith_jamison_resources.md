# Resources for Software Development

- Kevin Skoglund's course in git is an excellent course on the history and underworkings of using git. [Check it out here](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training-Basics-REVISION-2019-Q1/5030978-2.html)
- Likewise, [Kevin's course in the Unix commands is also immensely helpful.](https://www.lynda.com/Mac-OS-tutorials/Unix-Mac-OS-X-Users/78546-2.html)
- Finally, David Black's textbook ["The Well-Grounded Rubyist"](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-second-edition) is great to learn the basics of the Ruby language.
