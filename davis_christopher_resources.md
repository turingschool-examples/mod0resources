1. The Github [learning lab](https://lab.github.com/)- referenced this for merge conflict information but it's super useful, will check that out more at time continues.
2. Github [guides](https://guides.github.com/) - used this a few times but great markdown references
3. My partner is a CS major, so I'm leaning on them quite a bit. If you don't have a partner that is good with computers, don't fret. We're a team here and we'll reach out to each other for help.
4. Good music to work to is a fantastic help for me. I listen to ambient music, chillwave, and crunchy electronica. No lyrics to catch onto helps me a lot but whatever you can put on in the background to help your brain wander less works.
5. This is mainly focused on how to use the command line efficiently, but doing the Bandit [wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) at Over The Wire helped me to be less afraid of doing work in the terminal.
6. I'm still doing the prework, but after I finish that I'm definitely going to dive into as much as I can during my right before Turing gearup phase. My priorities after prework is the program that Josh Thompson linked to us on slack [here](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/ac68a974cb9e0d73d663ea6c8cf3e8d8), followed by the [Railsbridge Curriculum](http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/ruby/) and then some of the more advanced lessons about merges found in the Github learning lab I linked above.
7. Good food and sleep. Make yourself sleep and take breaks, even with a deadline. I use [Budgetbytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/) for the overwhelming majority of my meal prep recipes because they have great breakdowns of cost, easy scaling in the website for more or less portions, and a ton of styles including vegan and vegetarian options.
