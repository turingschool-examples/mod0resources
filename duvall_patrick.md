# Resources I've used preparing for Turing #

## Resources I've found effective ##
1. [Flatiron's bootcamp prep track](https://flatironschool.com/free-courses/coding-bootcamp-prep/). I finished this before applying to Turing
1. [FreeCodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), I completed through Javascript then dropped it and started focusing on ruby. If I was in frontend I would complete the javascript track.
1. [CodeCademy Ruby Track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby). I did this before the pre-work to build muscle memory as it was frustrating coming from JS and feeling I couldn't make my code do what I wanted in ruby.
1. [Michael Hartl's Learn Enough Series 1-3](https://www.learnenough.com/courses). These gave me, coming from absolutely zero experience, a solid grounding in text editor, git, and command line. I wish I had done them before the pre-work. I would strongly encourage anyone to do these ASAP.
1. [Ruby Docs](https://ruby-doc.org). I am currently in IRB going through, like a dictionary, and working on every command in different classes. It is unpleasant but my proficiency gains are rapid.
1. [This Git by Dave Maurer](https://github.com/davemaurer/daily_exercises) I didn't even think to look to github for training tracks until Tim pointed me that way.

##Resources I've found ineffective
1. [Zed Shaw's Learn Ruby the Hard way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/). I'm not sure why, but this series did not jive for me. I felt the progression of difficulty was erratic. I did appreciate the authors humor.
1. [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/). Maybe I'm not advanced enough or it moved too quickly. I felt the material was not what I needed.
1. [Michael Hartls Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). I felt I was doing a bunch of random things without necessarily having a solid understanding of ruby and systems to understand what was happening. Likely a solid resource I am not ready for.

## I am neutral on ##
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com). Is fun but not a great learning site. Kata are user submitted and may have errors or be poorly defined. I use this as a break and don't worry about it too much.
