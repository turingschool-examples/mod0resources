<h1>Dave's Resources</h1>
<p>These are the sites that are currently living in my bookmarks</p>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN: Main Site</a>
<p>We talked about MDN during Session 1 and I have used it several times. It's easy to find what you are looking for and provides examples with code.</p>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">MDN: HTML Elements Reference</a>
<p>Great place to find almost all HTML elements in one place. Command + F to find exactly what you need.</p>
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-html-forms/reference">Codecademy: Forms</a>
<p>This is a great reference to HTML form elements. Easy to read with examples in code</p>
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-html-tables/reference">Codecademy: Tables</a><p>Similar layout to the Forms site above but for tables</p>
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/bwa-javascript-reference">Codecademy: JavaScript Reference</a>Another Codecademy sheet, go figure. This one has a TON of information. I have used it a few times so far but know it will come in handy once we really dive down the JavaScript hole.</p>
