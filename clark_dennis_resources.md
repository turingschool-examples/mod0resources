## Favorite Resource....So far
### The best resources I've found so far include
- Google, since starting Mod 0 I've used google every single day for coding and proper syntax questions.
- MDN, this resource was pointed out by David for us frontenders. Definitely top three for me.
- Udemy, I actually used the learning programs prior to attending Turing. I found that I could look through the index for lessons on functions, objects, arrays etc..
- The Javascript book is a great tool as well, unfortunately the one I purchased was used and has fallen apart, thankfully theres a digital copy.
