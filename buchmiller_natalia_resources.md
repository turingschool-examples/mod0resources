To practice using the keys used in writing javascript and other coding languages, I've been using https://typing.io/

To get an overview of basic javascript concepts I've been watching https://www.youtube.com/c/GiraffeAcademy. I really like the way he describes things.

I haven't dived too deep into the https://lab.github.com/ site but I really liked their "Introduction to GitHub" and "Communicating Using Markdown" sections. I look forward to exploring more of the info there.

Although not specifically for software development, I found the following books very helpful when it comes to setting up some study practices and tools to help me get the most out of my time studying. "A Mind For Numbers" by Barbara Oakley and "Deep Work" by Cal Newport.
