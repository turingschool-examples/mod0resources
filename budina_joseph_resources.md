Ruby docs has been a great resource to begin to formulate understanding a new concept or method, however, the materiel can be a bit dense, thus making it somewhat difficult to put new ideas into practice. So, I usually move on to ruby guides if possible, because the content is far less technical which alleviates some of that initial confusion. From there I will use stackoverflow to see different ways to put specific things into practice, however, it typically has code that seems efficient to solve the immediate problem but leads to potentially sloppy code. If these resources don't work out for me, I will continue to google around looking for viable info( I'm spacing on names of specific sites, but will keep a better eye out after writing this). If you have any sources that you love, I would appreciate hearing about them (excluding turing recommended sites, because I'm already using them frequently!). Thanks!
