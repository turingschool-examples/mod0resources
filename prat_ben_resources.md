Some resources I have found to be helpful during the infancy of my education are:
+ Codeacademy website (I have zero coding experience outside of try coding and
  what I've taught myself)
+ The books *Deep Work* and *A Mind for Numbers* were both very good reads. The
former focuses on the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding
tasks. The latter delves into "how to learn" and how to learn omre deeply.
+ Different blog posts on **Medium**. They range in topic from how to make yourself
a better developer to essential apps for developers and everything in between. I
foresee using a lot of their suggestions once I get more comfortable with new skills.
