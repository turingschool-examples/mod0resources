'Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World'
by Clive Thompson

I just started 'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Strategy'
and am not entirely sure how much I'm going to like it. A friend recommended
it so I am excited to see how I can apply it.

Github docs is also been great when I run into issues or want to learn more
about using Git and Github.

Google, Google, Google!
