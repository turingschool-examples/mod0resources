**1. Launch School**

An online school for software engineers with a mastery-based curriculum.  You must be a paid subsciber to access their courses, however there are many free resources in the books section here.  I recommend reading the first four books for those new to programming and Ruby:

**2. Codecademy**

A well-known resource.  I completed their free Ruby course.  Highly recommended:

**3. *Learn to Program* by Chris Pine**

I worked through the beginning portion of this book around the time that I began my studies with Launch School.  I found it user-friendly and well-paced.  One day I may continue with it.
