## Resources

* W3schools has been great as they have a huge spread.


* MDN is definitely the best but is definitely highly documentation based without too much explanation


* stackOverflow is great and seems to be the resource i use the most honestly


* I have used Atom manual as a guide for keybindings and packages and things like that


* Codeacademy is great if i get board and want to tackle new ideas

* typing.io is for some reason incredibly fun for me, i love getting faster at typing in JS

* codepen.io is nice to dabble in html and css, trying to build a website for my family from the ground up on there
