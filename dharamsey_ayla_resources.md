These are the resources thus far that I've found most helpful:
stackoverflow.com - I use this to look up various questions and find reputable help.
typing.io - I think it's important that I don't make any mistakes while typiung, so this is helpful for that. 
trello.com - I need to ensure that I am on task and on time, so I think it's a very helpful tool.
