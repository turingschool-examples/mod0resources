##  Resources

1.  Ruby-doc: This is the official documentation for Ruby

2.  stackoverflow: This is like Yahoo answers for programmers, you can crowdsource answers to a question and it is a great place to search for programming related questions, just be sure the answers you use are highly upvoted and that the OP affirms it answered their question.

3.  mod-0-students-2001b slack channel: People are open to answering questions and answers and feedback are more specific to our particular coursework.

4.  help.github.com: I have used this a ton for git and github related questions. Super informative and relevant to pretty much everyone.
