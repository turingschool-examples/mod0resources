## My Favorite Resources
* Mod 0 Sessions
  * Practicing examples multiple times has been helpful, and it's a great source to use alongside my notes to remember the "why" behind my actions.
* DEV Community & Medium Articles
* MDN Website
* HTML & CSS / JavaScript & JQuery books by Jon Duckett
* Google, Google, Google!
  * Looking up YouTube videos has also been helpful to hear someone explain and show a concept, versus just reading.
