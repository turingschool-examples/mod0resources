I really enjoy the work we've done to this point in Terminal/Git/GitHub. I can see where this is eventually heading & am excited about the possibilities.

I also like that I'm getting more comfortable with keyboard shortcuts. Again, I can see how mastering these will be a key to success.

Finally, I'm thankful for my existing job where I've learned to write a bit of code (in Groovy). It's what really got me thinking about taking this step & I think has helped me understand many concepts which we'll be introduced to going forward.
