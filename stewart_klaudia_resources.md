I found the website https://dev.to/sublimegeek/git-staging-area-explained-like-im-five-1anh to be helpful with the idea of the git staging area.

This illustrative video on YouTube has been helpful with the various stages of git and GitHub: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org It helps even more since I am a visual learner

AND of course...Google has been tremendous in helping all sorts of random questions I've had about git and GitHub
