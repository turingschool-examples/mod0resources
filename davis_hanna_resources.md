# Resources
[Code School: Git Real](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=4b74d3f0-dd1e-43ac-b3b4-eb28a678d049) was a great resource for learning about git and github.  
I also read an article where Turing alumni suggested reading Atomic Habits by James Clear and Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol Dweck.
