1. The Mod0 2008A has been the most helpful resource to me so far!
2. Google (obviously)
3. Youtube tutorials! The information doesn't come up quick, but as a visual and tactile learner, it really helps me watching someone else do it
4. On github, I have starred a markdown cheat sheet that I look at daily!
