I talk to my brother alot. He has completed Turing before and pushed me to do this.
I have found that I like reading programming blogs, probably because I don't have all of the jargon down yet and I appreciate how they can make complex terms simpler to understand.
I spend alot of time fooling around in the terminal and practicing my programming typing.
Typing.io has been very helpful.
