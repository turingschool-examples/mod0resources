# My Favorite coding/git/GitHub/Turing resources so far.

Beginning to learn coding, is like learning a new language. Below are some of my favorite resources that I have been able to find so far.

   * First and foremost, the MOD 0 sessions/instructions are very beneficial
   * GOOGLE is a life saver
   * Ruby-doc.org
   * Alumni from Turing. I have been able to communicate with alumni by joining the Veterans channel on Slack.
   * My cousin, he attended Turing back in '16 I believe in the BE program. He has been a great resource
   * Did I mention [GOOGLE](https://www.google.com/)
