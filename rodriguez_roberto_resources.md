## Some of my favorite coding resources so far.

During this new stage of my life, I have used different various resources to insure that I operate at the highest level possible.

Some of the resources that I have used up to this point are...
   * Google
   * ruby-doc.org
   * Stack overflow website
   * Mod0 Slack channel
   * My notes from class sessions
   * My cousin who attended Turing and now works in coding

These have all helped me immensely up to this point.
