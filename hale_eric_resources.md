## Eric's Favorite resources

So far my favorite resource has been my fellow students. I love hearing the concepts
we are learning from my peers and looking at things from their perspective.
Not to mention learning about the resources they are using and looking into those
well.

I'm trying to warm-up to ruby-docs but it is still difficult to read.
