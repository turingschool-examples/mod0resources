## RESOURCES I USE ##
1. MDN - I really like their documentation. It can be obtuse sometimes, but that often just informs me about what I don't know, and maybe what I need to know before I keep going.
2. Stack Overflow - As long as I can find a thread with a similar problem this site is super helpful. I learn really well from examples so seeing a specific problem get fixed works for me.
3. Galvanize Test Prep - Yep so I was in the process of applying to Galvanize/HackReactor when I decided to start at Turing. Their test prep is super helpful as a source of daily coding problems.
