"This is a list of the resources I have found useful so far in Mod 0:"

"- Stackoverflow.com is an amazing resource for all aspects of the software/coding universe.  I even used this back when I did GIS and needed internal answers that required some level of scripting."

"- One of the most useful steps I've done so far has been to converse and talk things through with my fellow classmates.  Even if they don't have the answer I'm looking for by looking together we usually stumble on the best answer and understand it better through the process."

"- This ties a bit into the answer above, but I've found that by sending questions through slack I get enough information to usually piece something together myself."

"- The FreeCodeCamp website has some useful information and forums.  It's nice because most people on that site are learning as well so their questions often mirror my own."
