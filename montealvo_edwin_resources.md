I have really enjoyed the typing practice at typing.io. It's been a great way to get code
exposure while improving a related skill. The additional links provided have also been a
great way to get a little more in depth knowledge on the topics that we are covering. To me, It's often helpful to
have a concept explained multiple ways. It's similar to 2-D plan and it's 3-D model. The 2-D could provide
enough information to have a clear idea of an object, but the 3-D model can be seen from many more perspectives
and therefore the subtleties of shape can be fully appreciated. So, while I haven't used one consistent source,
I don't shy away from exploring a rabbit hole on topics we are covering and wading through the ton
of resources available to us until I can begin to grasp my own understanding of it. Often times, this doesn't come until
after a few mistakes have been made and practice time has been put in.
