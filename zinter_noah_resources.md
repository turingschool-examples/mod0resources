### Favorite Resources 

---

  **CodeAcademy** I've enjoyed using Code Academy as a way to familiarize myself with coding in _Ruby_ and _JavaScript_. 

  **Codewars** Codewars is another useful resource, it helps me get practice with solving code problems. 

  **Slack** I've subscribed to a number of Turing's Slack channels as a way to keep track of the kind of tasks and problems I should expect to encounter in my time at Turing. I've been able to solve problems I'm currently facing by looking through discussions on earlier cohorts' Slack pages.

  **StackOverflow** Whenever I run into a problem I try and google results in StackOverflow to see how others have dealt with the same issue. I've spent a lot of time with StackOverflow already solving various issues I've run into.
