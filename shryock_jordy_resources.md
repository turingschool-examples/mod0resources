The open source sharing of Github is pretty neat. The fact that anyone, anywhere in the world can collaboratively work together amazing.
The forking in Github is very interesting. You can take an open source project, fork it, clone it, and customize it to your needs.
 The daily practices have really sped up my computer use. Switching through tabs, quick commands, have made my life easier outside of programming.
