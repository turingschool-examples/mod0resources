My notebook! In the past I rarely referenced my old notes. I reference my notes constantly now.  
Google, this is obvious but it is without a doubt the best resource. Anything that my notes have not covered, google has.  
I google markdown cheatsheet nearly everyday. They provide all the info I need.  
google (app) shortcuts - I have been learning more shortcuts.  
https://www.speedcoder.net/ - My typing skills are lacking. This website teaches you good form and uses real code from the programming language of you choice for the practice material. No account, password, or signup necessary.
