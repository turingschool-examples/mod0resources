## MY FAVORATE NERD SOURCES!!!1one

  * [ruby-lang](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) as a master list with examples will never go out of style.
  * [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has been a great learning tool for ruby and other languages, with a comfortable learning pace. probably the tool i'm most grateful to have used over the last two years.
  * [github](https://github.com/) for collaborative projects, and solo stuff. probably going to be my bread and butter from here on out.
  * [repl](repl.it) because atom runner does not seem to ever work properly. here i can run code and see the outputs and errors from the same screen i code on. eventually i may know enough about atom to get runner working. repl apparently also interfaces with repositories.
  * [atom](atom.io) is just a kickass text editor with syntax color coding for many different languages.
  * [turing](turing.io) is a nerd incubator. and i am in need of incubation.

## last but far from least
i actually forgot to add these two most important coding links. unbelievable, unless you know me.
  * [google](google.com) how do i figure out how to implement this code? the answer always starts with google.
  * [youtube](youtube.com) like google, but in video version! tons of instruction and advice for just about anything.
