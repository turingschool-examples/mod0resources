# Mod 0 Resources


Hi! My journey in learning software development has been brief but I feel like I've already learned so much! Along the way, I've already started to compile a list of things that have helped me for future reference.

- **Codecademy** has been super helpful for me when I want a thorough but simple explanation, and an opportunity to *apply* what I just learned. You're able to write code in the moment, run it, and if it works, great! If not, you get feedback on what the error may be. If you're really stuck, you can view the solution.

- **YouTube** is also incredibly helpful, as long as you know that your video source is credible and up to date. Turing has provided video links throughout the Mod 1 Prework to credible folks with great things to say! These have been so helpful, especially when trying to grasp things that feel a little abstract in the moment.

- **Ask for help!** Not necessarily a resource, but a nice reminder in case ya'll forgot. I still struggle with this, but it's totally okay to not know the answer to something and to need to lean on the people around you/your resources.

- **Teaching someone else what I learned** has also been huge for me so far. It really allows me to know what areas I'm clear on, and what things still feel a little foggy. It also helps to try to take information that someone knows NOTHING about, and try to have them develop even a small understanding.


I'm sure there are several others but these are some of my favorites!
