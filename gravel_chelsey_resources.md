1. My biggest resource so far has been google.
2. The thing I'm  finding most helpful is note cards. And writing things down.
3. Codecademy has had some really helpful training courses.
4. YouTube videos, it's helpful to be able to watch some one doing something similar to what I'm doing.
5. My classmates. Seeing how they are taking on the work and how they are seeing things. I'm able to look at the situation in several different ways.
6. My friends who do coding. Either as a hobby or as their profession.
7. When making sure I understand a term, it has been so helpful to tell someone who knows nothing about code so I can really explain it and have them know what I am doing.
8. MDN Moz://a has been a good place to go look.
9. GitHub has a lot of good resource on it.
10. A helpful thing I have found is when I get stuck, is to just walk away for 20 minutes or an hour and just not think about it. When I came back it seems to get easier.
