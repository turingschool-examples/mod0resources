[**Emoji Unicode Reference**](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp)<br>
I haven't actually used this yet, but found it a while ago and thought it might be fun to use sometime.

[**Ruby: Symbols vs. Strings**](https://medium.com/@lcriswell/ruby-symbols-vs-strings-248842529fd9)<br>
Found this trying to figure out what a symbol was and how it's different than a string.

[**Another Markdown Reference Page**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)<br>
Found this one before I got to the resources provided in the homework somewhere.

[**Oh-my-zsh: Highlighting & Autosuggest**](https://gist.github.com/dogrocker/1efb8fd9427779c827058f873b94df95)<br>
I haven't actually installed oh-my-zsh yet, but saved this in case I wanted to later specifically for syntax highlighting and autosuggestions.

[**Gem: irbtools**](https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools)<br>
Was looking for how to make irb have syntax highlighting. Found this as a 'in the meantime' solution as I know we'll get into *pry* later.

* **Note_1:** I'm currently unsatisfied with this solution, but it's probably because I don't know enough about how to use it*

* **Note_2:** When trying to install *irbtools*, I ended up reading about how trying to install Ruby *Gems* on the system Ruby version doesn't work due to lack of system permissions.<br>After much searching, I realized I was missing a little line of code in my `.zshrc` file that would let me use the Ruby version I'd installed with *rbenv*.

[**Thoughtbot: Upcase**](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase)<br>
Saw this in an alumni channel on slack. Free resources to level up your skills in a variety of areas. I plan to use this to learn about the VIM editor later on.

[**josh_t 's Mod1 Prep**](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro)<br>
I actually found this the day I got accepted to Turing, before I knew I got accepted. Before I was in the slack channel. Got excited about it, bookmarked for later.

Josh's website in general is totally *awesome*! Here's another post about [*taking back your attention*](https://josh.works/take-back-your-attention) I intend to dive into soon. Here's one about the handy [*spaced repetition software, Anki*](https://josh.works/anki-spaced-repetition-system) to aid in memorization and learning!

[**TickTick**](https://ticktick.com/webapp/)<br>
If a productivity app has too many features, is too obtrusive, has too steep of a learning curve, or is hard to use, I just won't use it. So far, this one is working well. <br>

It lives in an icon in my status bar; I can click the icon and immediately see my checklist, as well as add new tasks using shorthand for *tags* and *priority*.
