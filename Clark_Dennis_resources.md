I've enjoyed using the Slack channel with my peers for questions on projects. I think this is a great resource because questions asked through the channel have and may help someone with a similar issue.
Google is king , at least when I'm using it correctly.
Git Hub/Help is another one that I've been using heavily.
I've checked out Youtube a few times but with hesitation because well, it's Youtube.
