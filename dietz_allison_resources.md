##### Misc **BLOGS** & **ARTICLES**

 * [Ellen Cornelius's tech blog](https://www.ellencornelius.com/), By Turing alum/instructor, Ellen Cornelius
  > I'm in the FE program, but reading her post on the *mutability of hashes* actually helped me in understanding and approaching my work on objects. Bonus: excellent cat content!

 * [Diana Lange's Portfolio](https://www.diana-lange.de/pages/portfolio/generative/nature_of_code/nature.html), By generative graphics artist Diana Lange
 > My pre-Turing background is in visual arts, so I was floored when I found this. I don't know quite how she does it *yet* but it's a spark of inspiration to know that her creative work is produced through programming and generative graphics - so cool! *Check out her 'Nature of Code' project!*

 * [6 Habits of SuperLearners](https://medium.com/personal-growth/6-habits-of-super-learners-63d466a254fd), by Thomas Oppong (2020)
 > Provided as supplemental reading in a Mod-0 Capstone small group, I found this article reinforces and synthesizes several of the best habits that I value &/or want to continue to develop, and backs that up with ultimate benefits to growth in learning. Because apparently I needed to be told it's ok to read more - it's not really idle; it's good for you!

 * [Learning Fluency](https://medium.com/@sarambsimon/learning-fluency-672988a7ae52), By Turing alum, Sara Simon (2015)
 > We may have all read this already as part of the assigned Mod-0 Session2 homework readings*responses, but I really enjoyed this article and felt that I found a lot of encouragement and wisdom in it. I might read it a few more times myself.
