# Resources

It might seem obvious, but by far the most common site I've used during Mod0 is the Mod0 Curriculum which can be found [here](http://mod0.turing.io/).

This came from the Mod0 Curriculum but I reference it often for writing in Markdown.  [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Before even attending Try Coding at Turing this summer, I found this [Ruby For Beginners](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/) tutorial.  It is where I got most of my base knowledge of Ruby.  Here I learned about data types and basics of how they are used.

If I don't understand something, it is usually helpful for me to watch a video about it.  YouTube has tons of videos about programming.  Mike Dane has a YouTube channel called [GiraffeAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw) and I've watched a few videos there to see how programming workflow happens.

Finally, it won't be a surprise to anyone that http://google.com gets used quite a bit to help me solve issues when I get stuck.  And when all else fails, Slack has been a great place for help too!
